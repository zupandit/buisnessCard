            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Calgary. Currently, I am working at the Advanced Database Systems
                and Applications (ADSA) Lab developing an ML Model to track the age of the moon. I also do full stack 
                development! Other than being experienced in PyTorch, OpenCV and MERN stack, I 
                have a lot of experience with other technologies. I am always looking to learn new things and I love introducing cutting
                edge technology in my projects.
